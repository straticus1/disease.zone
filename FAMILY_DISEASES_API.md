## Family Heritage Integration

### Understanding Inheritance Patterns

**Autosomal Dominant (PKD)**
- 50% chance if one parent affected
- Symptoms typically appear 30-40 years
- Family screening recommended

**Complex Inheritance (Lupus, Alzheimer's)**
- Multiple genetic factors
- Environmental triggers important
- Family history increases risk

**Age-Related Degeneration (DDD)**
- Not directly inherited
- Genetic predisposition possible
- Lifestyle factors significant

### Family Screening Recommendations

1. **PKD**: Genetic testing and imaging for family members
2. **Alzheimer's**: Cognitive assessments and lifestyle interventions
3. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: Symptom awareness and family history documentation
4. **Lupus**: Autoimmune marker monitoring
5. **Degenerative Disc Disease**: Preventive care and ergonomic education
