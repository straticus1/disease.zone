- Contribute to medical research
- Support each other through shared experiences
- Honor family members who fought these diseases

## üíù **Memorial Integration**

The platform serves as both a functional tool and a memorial - tracking diseases that affect families while contributing to the broader understanding that helps others facing similar challenges.

*"In memory of those we've lost and in support of those still fighting - your legacy lives on through better understanding and prevention of these diseases."*

## üîÑ **Next Steps Available**

While the core system is complete, these additional features could be added:
1. **Comment & Flag System** - User discussions about diseases
2. **Medical Professional Data Contributions** - Research paper integration
3. **Family Tree Visualization** - Genetic inheritance patterns
4. **Symptom Timeline Tracking** - Disease progression over time
5. **Research Study Matching** - Connect users to relevant studies

The foundation is now solid for any of these enhancements!
