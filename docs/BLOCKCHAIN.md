- **Use Case**: Global public health data, research incentives

**3. Solana**
- **Why**: High throughput, low costs
- **Benefits**: Fast consensus, growing healthcare ecosystem
- **Use Case**: Real-time surveillance data, IoT integration

## 💰 **Monetization Strategies**

### **1. Data Oracle Services**
```
• Verified disease data feeds to DeFi protocols
• Insurance companies pay for risk assessment data
• Research institutions subscribe to anonymized datasets
• Revenue: $0.01-0.10 per data point queried
```

### **2. Research Data Marketplace**
```
• Researchers purchase access to anonymized datasets
• Pharma companies buy trend analysis
• Government agencies subscribe to surveillance feeds
• Revenue: $1,000-50,000 per dataset license
```

### **3. Verification-as-a-Service**
```
• Hospitals pay to verify patient vaccination records
• Insurance companies verify health claims
• Travel industry verifies health certificates
• Revenue: $0.50-5.00 per verification
```

### **4. Tokenized Research Incentives**
```
• Users earn tokens for contributing health data
• Researchers pay tokens for data access
• Staking mechanisms for data validators
• Token value grows with platform adoption
```

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
```
Off-Chain: Sensitive PHI data (encrypted, HIPAA-compliant)
On-Chain: Data hashes, metadata, access permissions
Benefits: Immutable audit trail + privacy compliance
```

### **Smart Contract Functions**
```solidity
contract DiseaseTracking {
    function submitDataHash(bytes32 _hash, uint256 _timestamp) external
    function verifyData(bytes32 _hash) external view returns (bool)
