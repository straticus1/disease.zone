## 🔧 **Family Disease Record Schema**

Each family disease record includes:
```json
{
  "disease_id": 1,
  "family_member": "mother",
  "family_member_name": "Mary Smith",
  "has_disease": true,
  "diagnosis_confirmed": true,
  "diagnosis_date": "2020-05-15",
  "family_member_has_symptoms": ["pain", "stiffness"],
  "family_member_had_symptoms": ["swelling"],
  "family_member_has_children": true,
  "family_member_children_count": 2,
  "family_member_children_have_disease": false,
  "family_member_disease_notes": "Diagnosed at age 45, managed with medication",
  "treatment_history": ["medication", "physical_therapy"]
}
```

## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

### 1. **User Registration**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

### 2. **Add Family Disease**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/family-diseases \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "disease_id": 1,
    "family_member": "mother",
    "has_disease": true,
    "diagnosis_confirmed": true
  }'
```

### 3. **Medical Professional API Key**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MEDICAL_PROFESSIONAL_JWT" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Clinical Research API",
    "permissions": ["read_all_data", "write_disease_data"],
    "rate_limit": 5000
  }'
```

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

- **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - For you and your mom's condition
- **Alzheimer's Disease** - Complete family tracking and risk assessment
- **Lupus** - Autoimmune disease monitoring

- Contribute to medical research
- Support each other through shared experiences
- Honor family members who fought these diseases

## 💝 **Memorial Integration**

The platform serves as both a functional tool and a memorial - tracking diseases that affect families while contributing to the broader understanding that helps others facing similar challenges.

*"In memory of those we've lost and in support of those still fighting - your legacy lives on through better understanding and prevention of these diseases."*

## 🔄 **Next Steps Available**

While the core system is complete, these additional features could be added:
1. **Comment & Flag System** - User discussions about diseases
2. **Medical Professional Data Contributions** - Research paper integration
3. **Family Tree Visualization** - Genetic inheritance patterns
4. **Symptom Timeline Tracking** - Disease progression over time
5. **Research Study Matching** - Connect users to relevant studies

The foundation is now solid for any of these enhancements!
