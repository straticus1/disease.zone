## [3.1.3] - 2025-09-15

### üö® Critical Production Fixes - Domain Routing & Navigation

#### **Major Infrastructure Corrections**
- **Fixed Server Routing Logic**: Resolved critical issue where static middleware was intercepting requests before subdomain routing

  - **Title**: "diseaseZone - API Portal & Developer Dashboard"
  - **Content**: Developer-focused API documentation, search forms, quick links
  - **Navigation**: Proper cross-domain links pointing to main platform

#### **Navigation & User Experience Fixes**
- **Fixed Cross-Domain Navigation**: API portal now correctly links to main platform via `https://www.disease.zone/`
- **Removed Redundant Elements**: Eliminated conflicting "Launch Full Platform" button from static files
- **Seamless User Flow**: Users can now properly navigate between API documentation and main platform

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Server Route Priority**: Homepage routes now execute before static file serving
- **Subdomain Detection**: Enhanced host header parsing for reliable subdomain identification
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting routing decisions
- **Docker Deployment**: Successfully deployed via ECS with updated container image

#### **Verification & Testing**
- **Content Verification**: Confirmed distinct content serving for both domains
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Verified all interactive elements work on main platform
- **Navigation Testing**: Confirmed proper cross-domain navigation links
- **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed and verified in AWS ECS environment

#### **Infrastructure Status**
